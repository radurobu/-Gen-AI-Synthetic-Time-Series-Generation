# Synthetic Time Series Generation using GANs and Transformers

This repository contains the implementation of a novel approach for synthetic time series generation. The method combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Transformer architectures to produce high-quality synthetic time series data. This project is designed to address the challenges of generating realistic and diverse time series data for various applications.

# Key Features

GAN Architecture: Utilizes a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) to ensure stable training and high-quality outputs.

Transformer Models: Leverages the attention mechanisms of Transformers to capture complex temporal dependencies in time series data.

Synthetic Dataset: Trained on a dataset of sinusoidal waves, providing a controlled environment for evaluating the modelâ€™s performance.

PyTorch Implementation: Built entirely using PyTorch, ensuring modularity, flexibility, and scalability.
